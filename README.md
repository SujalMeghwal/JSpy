# JSpy
JSpy is a powerful reconnaissance tool designed to automate the process of gathering information about a list of domains. It creates output directories for each domain, extracts headers and response bodies, script endpoints and relative URLs, and runs nmap scans. Whether you're a bug bounty hunter, pen tester, or security researcher, JSpy is an essential tool for any reconnaissance mission. With JSpy, you can save time and increase your chances of finding vulnerabilities in your target domains.

🚀 Features:
* Extracts headers and response bodies
* Extracts script endpoints and downloads scripts
* Extracts relative URLs from scripts
* Runs nmap scans on each domain

## Requirement and How SETUP IT 
1. Make file name `scope.txt` that file contaiin single main domain your tagert
```bash 
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/path/to/directory]
└─# cat scope.txt
kiwi.com
````
2. Make a directory in root user name it Tools and download relative-url-extractor in it 
 ```bash 
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/path/to/directory]
└─# mkdir /root/Tool/ && cd /root/Tool/ && git clone https://github.com/jobertabma/relative-url-extractor.git

3. Make sure you have Bash installed on your system. You can check if Bash is installed by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash 
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/path/to/directory]
└─# bash --version
````
4. You must have alive.txt which conatain the sub-domains of your tagret in url form 
````bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/path/to/directory]
└─# cat alive.txt 
https://abaviaiton.kiwi.com
https://governorsaviation.kiwi.com
http://governorsaviation.kiwi.com
````
5. Make a Folder name it same as scope.txt domain name
````bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/path/to/directory]
└─# cat scope.txt
kiwi.com
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/path/to/directory]
└─# mkdir kiwi.com
````
6. Move alive.txt to kiwi.com Folder
````bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/path/to/directory]
└─# mv alive.txt /root/kiwi.com/
````
7.  Make sure you have Nmap installed on your system. You can check if nmap is installed by running that command in your terminal:
````bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/path/to/directory]
└─# nmap --help
Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org )
Usage: nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target specification}
````
8. Now you are ready to run that script 
````bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─# git clone https://github.com/SecuritySphinx/JSpy.git
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─# cd JSpy
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/JSpy]
└─# echo kiwi.com > scope.txt
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/JSpy]
└─# mkdir kiwi.com
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/JSpy]
└─# mv /root/Target/alive.com /root/JSpy/kiwi.com/
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/JSpy]
└─# bash jspy.sh scope.txt
````

## DataHound
This `DataHound` script uses command line options to search for the specified input inside the HTML, JavaScript, Nmap scans and header files. The script simply traverse through all the collected data and uses grep to find the matching keywords. 
````bash
root@ubuntu:~/example.com$ ./search.sh -h
[+]USAGE: ./search.sh  (OPTIONS)
-j (string) - search in javascript files
-x (string) - search in header files
-e (string) - search in  html files
-n (string) - search nmap scans
-h - help
````
> Move this `DataHound.sh` script in `JS` Folder of Target

### Examples to use  Datahound script
````bash
$ ./search.sh -j "admin"
$ ./search.sh -x "nginx"
$ ./search.sh -e "s3.amazonaws"
$ ./search.sh -n "ssh" #searching nmap scans for the string ssh
